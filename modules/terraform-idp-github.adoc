Configuring link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps[GitHub authentication] allows users to log in to OpenShift Container Platform with their GitHub credentials.

To prevent anyone with any GitHub user ID from logging in to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can restrict access to only those in specific GitHub organizations.

.Prerequisites
* You created your account roles using Terraform.
* You created your cluster using Terraform. This cluster can either have a managed OIDC configuration or an unmanaged OIDC configuration.
* *Optional:* You have configured your Terraform.tfvars file. 

.Setting up your application in GitHub
To use GitHub or GitHub Enterprise as an identity provider, you must register an application to use.

. Register an application on GitHub:
* For GitHub, click *Settings* → *Developer settings* → *OAuth apps* → *Register a new OAuth application*.
* For GitHub Enterprise, go to your GitHub Enterprise home page, and then click *Settings* → *Developer settings* → *Register a new application*.
. Enter an application name, for example `My OpenShift Install`.
. Enter a homepage URL, such as `https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster-name>.<cluster-domain>`.
. *Optional:* Enter an application description.
. Enter the authorization callback URL, where the end of the URL contains the identity provider `name`: `https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster-name>.<cluster-domain>/oauth2callback/<idp-provider-name>`.
For example: `https://oauth-openshift.apps.openshift-cluster.example.com/oauth2callback/Github`
+
[NOTE]
====
`<idp-provider-name>` is case-sensitive. See the link:https://github.com/terraform-redhat/terraform-provider-rhcs/blob/v1.3.0-prerelease.2/examples/create_identity_provider/github/main.tf#L37[Terraform pages] for more information on names.
====
+
. Click *Register application*. GitHub provides a client ID and a client secret. You need these values to complete the identity  provider configuration.

.Procedure

. When running Terraform, you configure your infrastructure through variables. For more on Terraform variables, see link:https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/variables/managing-variables[Managing Variables] in the Terraform documentation. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in this directory or add the following items to your existing `*.tfvars` file. You can also export the variables with the following commands:
+ 
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
variable "token" {
  type        = string
  description = "OCM token - You can get it here: https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token"
}

variable "cluster_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The OCP cluster ID"
}

variable "url" {
  type        = string
  description = "Provide OCM environment by setting a value to url"
  default     = "https://api.openshift.com"
}

# IDP Variables
variable "github_client_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "GitHub client id"
}
variable "github_client_secret" {
  type        = string
  description = "GitHub client secret"
}
variable "github_org" {
  type        = string
  description = "GitHub organization"
}
----
====
+
Run the following commands to export your variables. Provide your values in lieu of the brackets. Any values declared in your `variables.tf` file are the default values if you do not export a superseding value.
+
* This value is the generated GitHub client secret to validate your account. It can be found in the settings of your GitHub account. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_github_client_secret=<github_client_secret>
----
+
* This value is your GitHub client ID. It can be found in the settings of your GitHub account. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_github_client_id=<client_id>
----
+
* This value is your GitHub organization. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_github_orgs='["<github_org>"]'
----
+
* This variable should be your full link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[Openshift Cluster Manager offline token] that you generated in the prerequisites. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_token=<ocm_offline_token>
----
+
* This value should always point to `\https://api.openshift.com`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_url=https://api.openshift.com
----
+
* The ID of the cluster for which you are creating the identity provider. This ID can be found in the `rosa` command-line interface (CLI) with the command `rosa list cluster`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_cluster_id=<cluster_id>
----
+

. In your local copy of the `github` folder, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
terraform init
----
+
Running this command accesses all the necessary provider information to apply your Terraform plan.
. *Optional:* Run the `plan` command to ensure that your Terraform files build correctly without errors. This is not required to apply your Terraform plan.
+
[source,terminal]
----
terraform plan -out github.tfplan
----
+
. Run the apply command to create your GitHub identity provider.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you did not run the `plan` command, you can simply just `apply` without specifying a file.
====
+

+
[source,terminal]
----
terraform apply <"github.tfplan">
----
+
. Terraform applies the plan and creates your identity provider using GitHub. You will see a prompt to confirm you want to create your resources. Enter `yes`, then the process will complete with your resources.
                                                  
.Resource clean up
After you are done with the resources you created, you should not delete them manually, but instead, use the destroy command. Run the following to delete all of your created resources:

[source,terminal]
----
terraform destroy
----

After the command is complete, your resources are deleted.

[NOTE]
====
If you manually delete a resource, you create unresolvable issues within your environment.
