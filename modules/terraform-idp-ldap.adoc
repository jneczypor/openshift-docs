= LDAP
Configure the LDAP identity provider to validate user names and passwords against an LDAPv3 server, using simple bind authentication.

.Prerequisites
* You created your account roles using Terraform.
* You created your cluster using Terraform. This cluster can either have a managed OIDC configuration or an unmanaged OIDC configuration.
* *Optional:* You have configured your Terraform.tfvars file. 

.LDAP server and configuration
For more information about LDAP server authentication and configuration, see About LDAP authentication.

.Procedure

. When running Terraform, you configure your infrastructure through variables. For more on Terraform variables, see link:https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/variables/managing-variables[Managing Variables] in the Terraform documentation. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in this directory or add the following items to your existing `*.tfvars` file. You can also export the variables with the following commands:
+ 
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
variable "token" {
  type        = string
  description = "OCM token - You can get it here: https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token"
}

variable "cluster_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The OCP cluster ID"
}

variable "url" {
  type        = string
  description = "Provide OCM environment by setting a value to url"
  default     = "https://api.openshift.com"
}

# IDP Variables
variable "ldap_ca" {
  type        = string
  description = "Optional trusted certificate authority bundle"
}
variable "ldap_insecure" {
  type        = bool
  description = "Do not make TLS connections to the server."
  default     = false
}
variable "ldap_url" {
  type        = string
  description = "An RFC 2255 URL which specifies the LDAP search parameters to use."
}

+
Run the following commands to export your variables. Provide your values in lieu of the brackets. Any values declared in your `variables.tf` file are the default values if you do not export a superseding value.
+
* This variable is a Boolean expression that allows you to decide if TLS connections to the server are allowed. The default value is *false*. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_ldap_insecure=<true_or_false>
----
+
* This variable points to an RFC 2255 URL for your LDAP search parameters. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_ldap_url=<URL_for_parameters>
----
+
* This variable should be your full link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[Openshift Cluster Manager offline token] that you generated in the prerequisites. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_token=<ocm_offline_token>
----
+
* This value should always point to your OpenShift instance.
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_url=<ocm_url>
----
+
* The ID of the cluster for which you are creating the identity provider. This ID can be found in the `rosa` command-line interface (CLI) with the command `rosa list cluster`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_cluster_id=<cluster_id>
----
+
* *Optional:* This variable includes any additional trust certificate authority bundles.
+
[source,terminal]
----
export TF_VAR_ldap_ca=<trust-certificate-authority-bundle>
----
+

. In your local copy of the `ldap` folder, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
terraform init
----
+
Running this command accesses all the necessary provider information to apply your Terraform plan.
. *Optional:* Run the `plan` command to ensure that your Terraform files build correctly without errors. This is not required to apply your Terraform plan.
+
[source,terminal]
----
terraform plan -out ldap.tfplan
----
+
. Run the apply command to create your LDAP identity provider.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you did not run the `plan` command, you can simply just `apply` without specifying a file.
====
+

+
[source,terminal]
----
terraform apply <"ldap.tfplan">
----
+
. Terraform applies the plan and creates your identity provider using GitLab. You will see a prompt to confirm you want to create your resources. Enter `yes`, then the process will complete with your resources.
                                                  
.Resource clean up
After you are done with the resources you created, you should not delete them manually, but instead, use the destroy command. Run the following to delete all of your created resources:

[source,terminal]
----
terraform destroy
----

After the command is complete, your resources are deleted.

[NOTE]
====
If you manually delete a resource, you create unresolvable issues within your environment.
